# wordpress-custom-php-flowchart
Client wanted a specific look for their websites flowchart. I incorporated SVG in with HTML, CSS and PHP. The if statements are used in conjunction with a Wordpress plugin called Advanced Custom Fields. This plugin allows the client to add new fields to the flowchart and the styling will be automatic based on the number of columns and rows added to the flowchart.
